Training and Placement Department and the students. It has two different modules. The first one is for the Training Officers and Placement Officers which will be
addressed as TPO hereon, while the other module is for the students.


##Introduction
The Placement Application is a Mobile Application developed using Java for Android
Phones. It is very easy, simple and efficient to use. The process of Registering on the
application is very simple and hassle-free. The application has separate Login Pages
for TPO and for the Students. The TPO can upload information about the upcoming
drives as when they get the information. The students can view all the information
about the drive and opt which one they want to sit for you.

# Placement Application CMRIT
Placement Application is designed to facilitate effective communication between the Training and Placement Department and the students. The solution features two distinct modules: one for the Training and Placement Officers (TPO), and one for the students.

The Placement Application is a user-friendly mobile application designed for Android phones, built using Java technology. The application features an intuitive interface, making it simple and efficient for users to register and log in. The TPO module allows officers to easily upload information about upcoming job drives, while the student module provides an overview of all available drives, enabling students to make informed decisions about which opportunities to pursue.

The application's separate login pages and streamlined registration process ensure the security and privacy of sensitive information, while its intuitive design enhances the overall user experience and supports the efficient exchange of information between the Training and Placement Department and the students.
